# ControlCommands

WIP

Ideas:

Alias /controlcommands to /cc (possibility to disable)

- /cc muffle (on|off) (muffled chat, defaults to on)
- /cc blind (on|percentage|off) (black overlay with opacity, defaults to on)
- /cc mute (on|off) (disable chat input, defaults to on)
- /cc deaf (on|off) (hide chat messages, defaults to on)
- /cc drunk (on|off) (screen effect overlay, defaults to on)
- /cc bound (on|off) (disable move controls, defaults to on)
- /cc follow target (force follow, defaults to <t>)
- /cc confine (on|off) (can't leave room/house, defaults to on)
- /cc fpv (on|off) (force first person view, defaults to on)

Safe keybind by default on END (configuration window)
