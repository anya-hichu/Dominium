# ControlCommands

WIP

Ideas:

Alias /controlcommands to /cc (possibility to disable)

- /cc enable (on|toggle|off)
- /cc muffle (on|toggle|off) - muffled chat, defaults to on
- /cc blind (on|toggle|percentage|off) - black overlay with opacity, defaults to on
- /cc mute (on|toggle|off) - disable chat input, defaults to on
- /cc deaf (on|toggle|off) - hide chat messages, defaults to on
- /cc drunk (on|toggle|off) - screen effect overlay, defaults to on
- /cc bound (on|toggle|off) - disable move controls, defaults to on
- /cc follow target (on|toggle|off) - force follow, defaults to on (quote support)
- /cc confine (on|toggle|off) - can't leave room/house, defaults to on
- /cc fpv (on|toggle|off) - force first person view, defaults to on

Safe keybind by default on END (configuration window)

Other friend plugin?
- Puppet master like with ACL (token) where can send base64 gzipped "command list" with id/names/alias to share (copy-paste manual operation) or generated file - Token gives permission to specific commands to a specific person (character name/world) for specific duration or until invalidated
- Custom syntax like <cc.3> or alias (button to automatically add in chat or copy in clipboard)
