# Dominium

WIP

Companion plugon to https://github.com/anya-hichu/ControlCommands

Ideas:

/dominium (config/enable/disable/toggle)

- Puppet master like with ACL (token) where can send base64 gzipped "command list" with id/names/alias to share (copy-paste manual operation, possibility to make it look like data:image/gif;base64,xxx or random link param) or generated file - Token gives permission to specific commands to matching characters (regex) for specific duration or until invalidated
- Custom syntax like <do.id> or alias with regex (!alias) or <do.alias> (button to automatically add in chat or copy in clipboard)

- Add context menu actions?

Don't need to be installed on both like puppetmaster but command viewer makes it easier to use
